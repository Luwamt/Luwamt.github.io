1.A The difference is 
the first one is execute after 2000 min , which  is correct way 

1.B, The second one ruin the functionality of the waiting time because,
 first execute the function, then returing nothing(Undifined) so there is 
 no item to execute.

 2,alert(x) : This returns 6
alert(y(2,3)): This returns 6

3,In This case it is same with the problem one, 
first execute the booyah2() function, then after 2000 miliSeconds nothing to excecute
which is Undifine. 
Then after that  booyah1 is excute after  2000 miliSeconds.


Unobtrusive Javascript: This means it is a good way separating 
the Javascript and CSS files from writing inside the html files..
Good to use as extrenal files.
