1. Which, if any, of the following 3 code fragments are equivalent? Explain why they are different, if
they are. Explain why they can have different parameters and be equivalent, if they are equivalent.
//code fragment 1
$("li").each(function(idx, e) {
 $(e).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
//code fragment 2
$("li").each(function() {
 $(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
//code fragment 3
$("li").each(function(idx) {
 $(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });

 Answer: All the 3 code fragments are equivalent all they give same result ,but have different parameters, 
 In first code fragment they use index for the postion of the selector and element which is the current element.
 In second code fragment they use the this keyword, which is explicitly used for the current select element, so this give same result.
 In third code fragment they use index and this its same thing with above codes.
